= VEX Support

VEX is a format used to convey information about the exploitability of
vulnerabilities in software products and share them with scanning tools.

The use of this format can sensitively reduce the number of
vulnerabilities in the final vulnerability report, which is more often
full of false positives entries.

If you want to know more about VEX, take a look

== VEX Hub

VEX Hub is a place where VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange)
documents from different open-source projects are collected and
organized. It helps people and security tools find and use important
information about software vulnerabilities more easily.

https://github.com/aquasecurity/vexhub[here].

== Getting Started

In order to scan `Registries` using VEX, you just have to create (one,
or more) `VEXHub` resources.

Here’s an example of `VEXHub` resource (you can find it under
https://github.com/kubewarden/sbomscanner/blob/main/examples/vexhub.yaml[`examples/vexhub.yaml`]:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sbomscanner.kubewarden.io/v1alpha1
kind: VEXHub
metadata:
  name: kubewarden
spec:
  url: "https://github.com/kubewarden/vexhub"
  enabled: true
----

Apply the resource with:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f examples/vexhub.yaml
----

Then, run the scan applying a
https://github.com/alegrey91/sbomscanner/blob/main/examples/scanjob.yaml[`ScanJob`]
configured to scan the desired registry.

SBOMscanner will automatically detect the presence of `VEXHub` resources
and will include them in the scan.

Since `VEXHub` CRD is cluster-scoped, this means that you can use the
same configuration across multiple registries.

=== Managing Multiple VEX Hub Repositories

You can configure an arbitrary number of `VEXHub` repositories within
your cluster.

If, for some reasons, you want to disable some of them, you can just
patch their `spec.enabled` to `false`.

This will let SBOMscanner exclude the `VEXHub` resource when scanning
the registries.

Here’s the command to disable a `VEXHub` resource:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl patch vexhub <vexhub-name> -p '{"spec":{"enabled":false}}'
----
