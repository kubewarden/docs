If you notice an issue with Kubewarden documentation or want to suggest new content, then open an issue.
You only require access to a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) and a browser.

Usually, any new documentation work for Kubewarden begins with an issue in GitHub. The [Kubewarden documentation team](https://github.com/orgs/kubewarden/teams/kubewarden-documentation) reviews, categorizes, and tags them.
Everybody is welcome to work on any issue, including the reporter, but you should assign it to yourself before commencing any work to avoid duplicate efforts.

## Opening an issue

To suggest improvements to existing documentation content or report an error open an issue.

- Click the GitHub Octocat icon at the top.
  This redirects you to the [documentation repository for Kubewarden](https://github.com/kubewarden/docs).
- Navigate to the Issues tab and click **New issue**.
- Describe the issue or suggestion for improvement. The more details, the better.
- Click **Submit new issue**.
- After submitting the issue, you can either assign it to yourself or wait for a community member to pick it up.
  Members of the documentation team and the community might request clarifications before they can act on your issue, so we request that you actively check your issue or [turn on GitHub notifications](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications).

## New content suggestions

To suggest new content, please file an issue as above. Either:

- Choose an existing page in the section you think the content belongs in and click **Create an issue**.
  OR
- Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/kubewarden/docs/issues/new/choose) and file the issue directly.

## How can you make a contribution count?

No contribution is too big or small.
However, so the community derives maximum value,
we request that you follow the below when reporting an issue:

- Focus on providing a clear description of the issue.
  Some key points to consider would be specifically describing what's missing, outdated, erroneous, or requires qualitative/technical improvement.
- Detail the specific impact the issue has on users.
- Delimit the scope of the issue.
  If the scope is larger, we'd request you to break it down to smaller tasks within an issue.
  For example, "Creating a Contribution Guide" is very wide in scope since there would be multiple tasks associated with the issue.
  However, "Fixing a grammatical error on the Quickstart page" is a more narrowly scoped issue that would require only a single pull request.
- Crosscheck existing issues to avoid duplicate work.
- Check for an existing pull request or issue.
  Check you reference the existing issue or pull request within the issue you're opening to give context for contributors who may want to work on it.
