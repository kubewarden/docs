Kubewarden organizes project documentation as follows:

- [Introduction](./introduction.md)
- [Quick start](./quick-start.md)
- _Tutorials_ — learning through examples.
- _Explanations_ — underlying concepts.
- _Howtos_ — getting Kubewarden tasks done.
- _Reference_
- Organization — this page
- [Personas](./personas.md) — who is Kubewarden for?
- [Security](./disclosure.md)
- [Glossary](./glossary.md)

Most of the material is in the four sections,
_Tutorials_, _Explanations_, _Howtos_, and _Reference_.
There may be overlap as the sections aren't mutually exclusive.
The Kubewarden project tries to follow the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) documentation framework

## Navigation

The left hand contents menu always indicates your current document location.
The right hand sections menu shows the current page sections.
There is also a 'breadcrumbs' feature at the top of the main content panel on each page.

## Search

A search box facility is in the header panel of each page.

## Editing

A link to the page source on GitHub is at the bottom of each page.

## Other resources

Also maintained are:

- [RFC](https://github.com/kubewarden/rfc)s for the project.
- A series of [blogposts](https://www.kubewarden.io/blog/) largely related to Kubewarden releases.
- Items related to the [community](https://github.com/kubewarden/community) management of Kubewarden.
