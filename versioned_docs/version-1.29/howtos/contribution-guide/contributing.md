_Kubewarden welcomes suggestions for improvement from all contributors, whether new or experienced._

You can contribute to Kubewarden documentation by:

- Improving existing content
- Creating new content
- (_Upcoming_) Helping with translation of the documentation

## Getting started

Everybody is welcome to suggest changes by submitting a pull request. You can
also report a bug or typo with the help of a GitHub issue to the
[`kubewarden/docs` repository](https://github.com/kubewarden/docs).

To get involved with the documentation:

- Familiarize yourself with the [documentation
  repository](https://github.com/kubewarden/docs) and the [static site
  generator](https://docusaurus.io/).
- Docusaurus makes use of the Markdown syntax and uses
  [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) as the parser.
- Understand how to [suggest an improvement](./suggesting-an-improvement) and
  open a pull request.
