The Kubewarden team appreciates investigative work on security
vulnerabilities carried out by well-intentioned, ethical security researchers.
Kubewarden follows the practice of [responsible
disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) to
best protect Kubewarden's user base from the impact of security issues. On
Kubewarden's side, this means:

- Kubewarden responds to security incidents on priority.
- Kubewarden releases fixes for issues as soon as is practical, prioritizing by risk.
- Kubewarden always transparently lets the community know about any incident that
  affects them.

If you have found a security vulnerability in Kubewarden, the easiest way to
report a vulnerability is through the [Security tab on
GitHub](https://github.com/kubewarden/community/security/advisories). This
mechanism allows maintainers to communicate privately with you, and you don't
need to encrypt your messages.

Alternatively, you can disclose it responsibly by emailing
[cncf-kubewarden-maintainers@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-kubewarden-maintainers@lists.cncf.io)
in an **unencrypted** message. Please do not discuss potential vulnerabilities in public without validating
with us first.

You can also come talk in our [slack-room] on the Kubernetes Slack server.

On receipt, the security team:

- Reviews the report, verifies the vulnerability and responds with confirmation
  and/or further information requests.
- After addressing the reported security bug, Kubewarden notifies the
  Researcher, who is then welcome to optionally disclose publicly.

Please, refer to the [community
repository](https://github.com/kubewarden/community) to find more about the
project Governance and Security Policy.
