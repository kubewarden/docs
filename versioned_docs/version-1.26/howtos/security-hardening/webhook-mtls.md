This guide shows you how to enable mutual TLS (mTLS) for all the webhooks used by the Kubewarden
stack when using [K3s](https://k3s.io/) as your Kubernetes distribution.

For more information on how to harden the webhooks, see the [reference
page](../../reference/security-hardening/webhooks-hardening).

## Prerequisites

Before installing K3s, you need to create a certificate authority (CA) and a client certificate to use to secure the communication between the Kubewarden webhooks and the Kubernetes API server.

As a first step, create the `/etc/rancher/k3s/admission/certs` directory:

```console
sudo mkdir -p /etc/rancher/k3s/admission/certs
```

### Create a root CA and the client certificate

As `root` user, change directory to the `/etc/rancher/k3s/admission/certs` directory and
create all needed certificates:

```console
export FQDN=mtls.kubewarden.io

# Create openssl config file
cat > openssl.cnf <<EOL
[ req ]
default_keyfile     = rootCA.key
distinguished_name  = req_distinguished_name
x509_extensions     = v3_ca
string_mask         = utf8only

[ req_distinguished_name ]
countryName         = Country Name (2 letter code)
countryName_default = US
stateOrProvinceName = State or Province Name (full name)
localityName        = Locality Name (eg, city)
organizationName    = Organization Name (eg, company)
commonName          = Common Name (eg, your domain or your CA name)

[ v3_ca ]
subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid:always,issuer
basicConstraints = critical, CA:true, pathlen:1
keyUsage = critical, keyCertSign, cRLSign
EOL

# Create CA
openssl req -nodes -batch -x509 -sha256 -days 3650 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout rootCA.key -out rootCA.crt \
  -config openssl.cnf

# Create CSR
openssl req -nodes -batch -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout client.key -out client.csr \
    -addext "subjectAltName = DNS:$FQDN"  -config openssl.cnf

# Create CRT
openssl x509 -req -CA rootCA.crt -CAkey rootCA.key -in client.csr -out client.crt -days 3650 -CAcreateserial \
    -extfile <(echo "subjectAltName=DNS:$FQDN")

# Print CRT
openssl x509 -text -noout -in client.crt
```

The following files should have been created:

- `client.crt`
- `client.csr`
- `client.key`
- `rootCA.crt`
- `rootCA.key`
- `rootCA.srl`

### Create the Kubernetes configuration file

Create the `/etc/rancher/k3s/admission/admission.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
# /etc/rancher/k3s/admission/admission.yaml
apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: AdmissionConfiguration
plugins:
  - name: ValidatingAdmissionWebhook
    configuration:
      apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
      kind: WebhookAdmissionConfiguration
      kubeConfigFile: "/etc/rancher/k3s/admission/kubeconfig"
  - name: MutatingAdmissionWebhook
    configuration:
      apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
      kind: WebhookAdmissionConfiguration
      kubeConfigFile: "/etc/rancher/k3s/admission/kubeconfig"
```

Finally, create a `kubeconfig` file at `/etc/rancher/k3s/admission/kubeconfig`:

```yaml
# /etc/rancher/admission/kubeconfig
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
users:
  - name: "*.kubewarden.svc" # namespace where the kubewarden stack is deployed
    user:
      client-certificate: /etc/rancher/k3s/admission/certs/client.crt
      client-key: /etc/rancher/k3s/admission/certs/client.key
```

### Create a K3s configuration file

Create a K3s configuration file at `/etc/rancher/k3s/config.yaml`:

```yaml
# /etc/rancher/k3s/config.yaml
kube-apiserver-arg:
  - admission-control-config-file=/etc/rancher/k3s/admission/admission.yaml
```

## Install K3s

Install K3s using the following command:

```console
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

Wait for the installation to complete.

## Install the Kubewarden stack

### Prerequisites

The certificate of the root CA, that issued the Kubernetes client certificate, must be made available to
the Kubewarden stack.

The root CA is available at `/etc/rancher/k3s/admission/certs/rootCA.crt` on the Kubernetes node. Its content
has to be put into a `ConfigMap` under the `kubewarden` namespace. The contents of the `rootCA.crt` file
must be stored in a key named `client-ca.crt`.

First, create the `kubewarden` namespace:

```console
kubectl create namespace kubewarden
```

Then create the `ConfigMap` in it. The following command, run on the Kubernetes node,
does that:

```console
kubectl create configmap -n kubewarden api-server-mtls \
    --from-file=client-ca.crt=/etc/rancher/k3s/admission/certs/rootCA.crt
```

The resulting `ConfigMap` is named `api-server-mtls`.

### Install the Kubewarden stack

Install the Kubewarden stack as described in the [quickstart guide](../../quick-start.md).
Follow all the steps, but when installing the `kubewarden-controller` Helm chart, make sure to
enable the following values:

- `mTLS.enable`: must be set to `true`.
- `mTLS.configMapName`: must be set to name of the `ConfigMap` that was previously created.

Given the `ConfigMap` was named `api-server-mtls`, the Helm command to install the `kubewarden-controller`
is:

```console
helm install --wait -n kubewarden kubewarden-controller kubewarden/kubewarden-controller \
    --set mTLS.enable=true \
    --set mTLS.configMapName=api-server-mtls
```

Once this command finishes, the Kubewarden stack is installed and its webhooks are secured with mTLS.
