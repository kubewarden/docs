# Context aware policies

The `policy-server` has capabilities to expose cluster information to
policies, so that they can take decisions based on other existing
resources, and not only based on the details provided by the admission request.

The retrieval of Kubernetes resources is performed by the Policy Server hosting the policy.
Access to Kubernetes is regulated by RBAC rules applied to the Service Account used by the Policy Server.

The `default` Policy Server deployed by Kubewarden helm charts has access to the following Kubernetes resources:

* Namespaces
* Services
* Ingresses

:::info
Access to Kubernetes resources is currently available only to Kubewarden policies written using traditional programming languages. This is not available yet for Rego-based policies.
:::

:::caution
The policy server performs caching of the results obtained from the Kubernetes API server to reduce the amount of load of this core piece of Kubernetes.
That means some information might be stale or missing.

### ClusterAdmissionPolicies

ClusterAdmissionPolicies have the field [spec.contextAwareResources](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/kubewarden/kubewarden-controller/policies.kubewarden.io/ClusterAdmissionPolicy/v1#spec-contextAwareResources). This field provides a list a `GroupVersionKind` resources that the policy needs to access. This allows policy writers to ship the "permissions" that the policy needs together with the policy. Moreover, this allows policy operators to review the "permissions" needed by the policy at deployment time.

### Testing context aware policies locally

Apart from running policies in cluster for end-to-end tests, one can use our `kwctl` CLI utility to run policies and mock requests against the cluster.

For that, `kwctl run` can first record all the interactions with the cluster into a file:

```console
kwctl run \
    --allow-context-aware \
    -r request.json \
    --record-host-capabilities-interactions replay-session.yml \
    annotated-policy.wasm
```

which creates the following `replay-session.yml` file:

```yaml
# replay-session.yml
---
- type: Exchange
  request: |
    !KubernetesGetResource
    api_version: /v1
    kind: Pod
    name: p-testing
    namespace: local
    disable_cache: true
  response:
    type: Success
    payload: '{"apiVersion":"","kind":"Pod", <snipped> }'
```

With the replay session, one can now mock the cluster interactions without the need
of a cluster, perfect for CI and end-to-end tests:

```console
kwctl run \
    --allow-context-aware \
    -r request.json \
    --replay-host-capabilities-interactions replay-session.yml \
    annotated-policy.wasm
``` 

### Language SDKs

Language SDK's that support cluster context at this time will expose
functions that allow policies to retrieve the current state of the
cluster.
