# Policy communication specification

The policy evaluator interacts with Kubewarden policies using a well
defined API.  The purpose of this section is to document the API used
by the host ( be it `policy-server` or `kwctl`) to communicate with
Kubewarden's policies.

:::note
This section of the documentation is a bit low level, you can
jump straight to one of the "language focused" chapters and come back to this
chapter later.
