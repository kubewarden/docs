The Kubewarden team greatly appreciates investigative work into security
vulnerabilities carried out by well-intentioned, ethical security researchers.
We follow the practice of [responsible
disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) in order to
best protect Kubewarden's user-base from the impact of security issues. On our
side, this means:

- We will respond to security incidents on priority.
- We will release fixes for issues as soon as is practical, keeping in mind that not all risks are created equal.
- We will always transparently let the community know about any incident that affects them.

If you have found a security vulnerability in Kubewarden, we kindly ask that you
disclose it responsibly by emailing kubewarden@suse.de. Please do not discuss
potential vulnerabilities in public without validating with us first.

On receipt the security team will:

- Review the report, verify the vulnerability and respond with confirmation
  and/or further information requests.
- Once the reported security bug has been addressed we will notify the
  Researcher, who is then welcome to optionally disclose publicly.
