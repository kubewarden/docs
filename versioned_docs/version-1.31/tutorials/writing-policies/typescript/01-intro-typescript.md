:::note
TypeScript/JavaScript support for WebAssembly is rapidly evolving.
This page was last revised in November 2025.
:::

As stated on the [official website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):

> TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding types.
>
> By understanding JavaScript, TypeScript saves you time catching errors and
> providing fixes before you run code.

Kubewarden uses [Javy](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy) (a Bytecode Alliance project) to build WebAssembly binaries from JavaScript and TypeScript.

> Javy takes your JavaScript code and executes it in a WebAssembly context. 
>
> It features an embedded QuickJS engine compiled to WebAssembly that can execute JavaScript. 
>
> The project provides both a CLI and a set of APIs for embedding and customizing the behavior when running JavaScript in WebAssembly.

The Kubewarden project currently uses Javy for these reasons:

- Mature JavaScript engine (QuickJS) compiled to WebAssembly.
- Support for [WASI interface](../wasi/01-intro-wasi.md) through custom host functions.
- Smaller binary sizes compared to other JavaScript-to-WebAssembly solutions.
- Active development and maintenance by the Bytecode Alliance.

## Javy limitations

Javy runs JavaScript in a sandboxed WebAssembly environment with certain constraints:

- **WASI environment only**: Access limited to stdin/stdout/stderr and explicitly provided host capabilities.
- **No Node.js APIs**: Standard Node.js modules like `fs`, `http`, or `crypto` aren't available.
- **Limited standard library**: Only core JavaScript features and explicitly enabled APIs are accessible.
- **Single-threaded execution**: No support for Web Workers or multi-threading.

Despite these limitations, Javy provides sufficient capabilities for writing effective Kubewarden validation policies through the hosts capabilities system.

:::warning 
Writing to STDOUT breaks policies - use STDERR for logging instead.

## Tooling

Writing Kubewarden policies requires:

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime.
- **npm**: For dependency management.
- **TypeScript**: Recommended for type safety (optional).

:::warning
Ensure you're using Node.js 18 or higher. Older versions may not be compatible with the compilation toolchain.
:::

These TypeScript/JavaScript libraries are useful when writing a Kubewarden policy:

- [Kubewarden JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/kubewarden/policy-sdk-js): Provides structures and functions reducing the amount of code necessary. It also provides test helpers and access to all host capabilities.
- [Kubernetes TypeScript types](https://github.com/silverlyra/kubernetes-types): Provides TypeScript definitions for all Kubernetes resources, enabling type-safe policy development.

The Kubewarden project provides a [template JavaScript/TypeScript policy project](https://github.com/kubewarden/js-policy-template) you can use to create Kubewarden policies.

## Getting the toolchain

The easiest way to get the toolchain is by using the Kubewarden JavaScript SDK, which includes the Javy compilation plug-in:

```bash
npm install kubewarden-policy-sdk
```

The Javy plug-in binary is automatically included and you can find it at:

```
node_modules/kubewarden-policy-sdk/plugin/javy-plugin-kubewarden.wasm
```

## Tutorial prerequisites

During this tutorial you need these tools on your development machine:

- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher with npm for dependency management.
- [**`bats`**](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core): Used to write the tests and automate their execution.
- [**`kwctl`** ≥ `v1.30`](https://github.com/kubewarden/kwctl/releases): CLI tool provided by Kubewarden to run its policies outside of Kubernetes, among other actions. It's covered in [the testing policies section](../../testing-policies/index.md) of the documentation.
- [**`javy`** ≥ `6.0.0`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy): CLI tool for compiling JavaScript code to WebAssembly modules.
