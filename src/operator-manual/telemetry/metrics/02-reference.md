# Metrics Reference

Kubewarden exposes some relevant metrics that enhance visibility of the platform, and allows cluster
administrators and policy developers to identify patterns and potential issues.

## Policy Server

The Policy Server is the component that initializes and runs policies. Upon receiving requests from
the Kubernetes API server, it will forward the request to the policy, and return the response
provided by the policy to the Kubernetes API server.

### Metrics
