# Distribute policy

Congratulations for having made this far 🎉🎉🎉

We hope you enjoyed the journey!

In case you haven't realized, we actually created the
[safe-labels-policy](https://github.com/kubewarden/safe-labels-policy)
together.

There's nothing special to be done when it comes to distributing the
policy. If you followed this guide you have already published
your policy using the GitHub `release.yml` Action defined in the previous
chapter.

The topic of distributing policies is covered in depth inside of the
["distributing policies"](/distributing-policies.md)
section of Kubewarden's documentation.
