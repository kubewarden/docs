# Context aware policies

The `policy-server` has capabilities to expose cluster information to
policies, so that they can take decisions based on other existing
resources, and not only based on the details provided by the admission request.

The retrieval of Kubernetes resources is performed by the Policy Server hosting the policy.
Access to Kubernetes is regulated by RBAC rules applied to the Service Account used by the Policy Server.

The `default` Policy Server deployed by Kubewarden helm charts has access to the following Kubernetes resources:

* Namespaces
* Services
* Ingresses

:::info
Access to Kubernetes resources is currently available only to Kubewarden policies written using traditional programming languages. This is not available yet for Rego-based policies.
:::

:::caution
The policy server performs caching of the results obtained from the Kubernetes API server to reduce the amount of load of this core piece of Kubernetes.
That means some information might be stale or missing.
:::

Language SDK's that support cluster context at this time will expose
functions that allow policies to retrieve the current state of the
cluster.
