The first place to start is the introduction, '[What is Kubewarden?](introduction.md)'.

## Who is this documentation for?

This documentation is for the Kubewarden community.
We have a few defined personas or users of Kubewarden.

- [Policy user](personas/kubewarden-user).
Someone who takes a policy and uses it in a cluster.
They don’t develop policies and may not be software developers.
Their work is around running a policy in a cluster and seeing the results of that.

- [Operator](personas/kubewarden-operator).
Someone who operates KW in a cluster.
The person responsible for installing KW and keeping it up to date.
This is an ops/devops role.

- [Policy developer](personas/kubewarden-policy-developer).
Someone who writes a policy. Has software development skills.

- [Policy distributor](personas/kubewarden-distributor).
Someone who has written a policy and wants to share it with others.
They want the policy to be easily consumed by the “policy consumer” role.

- [Integrator](personas/kubewarden-integrator).
Those who want to build on top of Kubewarden.
This could be a custom UI, a helper tool for generating policies, or something else.

- [Developer](personas/kubewarden-developer).
People who develop Kubewarden. The project maintainers.

## What documentation types are there?

We have adopted the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr) approach to document types.

|[How-to](doc-types/howto)|Getting something *done*.|

## What topics does the documentation cover?

## Keywords used in the documentation

Index? Word cloud with links?

## Glossary

Should we have one of these. Maybe it's too like the keyword index?
