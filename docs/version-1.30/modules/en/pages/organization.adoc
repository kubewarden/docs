:description: How is the {project-name} documentation organized?
:keywords: ["admission policy manager", "{project-name}", documentation, organization]
:doc-persona: [kubewarden-all]
:doc-type: [explanation]
:doc-topic: [explanation]

{project-name} organizes project documentation as follows:

* xref:/introduction.adoc[Introduction]
* xref:/quick-start.adoc[Quick start]
* _Tutorials_—learning through examples.
* _Explanations_—underlying concepts.
* _How-tos_—getting {short-project-name} tasks done.
* _Reference_
* Organization—this page
* xref:/personas.adoc[Personas]—who is {short-project-name} for?
* xref:/disclosure.adoc[Security]
* xref:/glossary.adoc[Glossary]

Most of the material is in the four sections, _Tutorials_, _Explanations_,
_How-tos_, and _Reference_. There may be overlap as the sections are not
mutually exclusive. The {short-project-name} project tries to follow the
link:https://diataxis.fr/[Diátaxis] documentation framework.
