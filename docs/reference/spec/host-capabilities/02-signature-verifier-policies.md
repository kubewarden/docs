Kubewarden implements support for the [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/)
project. This allows to implement a Secure Supply Chain for your cluster.

Part of that is to ensure that all container images running in the cluster are
signed and verified, proving that they come from their stated authors, and
haven't been tampered with. For further reading, do check out the docs on
[how we implement a Secure Supply Chain for the policies themselves](../../../howtos/secure-supply-chain.md)).

Sigstore signatures are stored inside of container registries, next to the OCI
object being signed; be it a container image or a more generic OCI artifact,
like a Kubewarden policy. Given an object to be signed, all its signatures are
going to be stored as layers of a special OCI object created by sigstore.
Policies that want to check Sigstore signatures of containers need then to check
those layers, and would need to pull the signature layers to see the
signatures themselves.

Obtaining and operating with those OCI layers needs to happen outside of the
WebAssembly guest (the policy). Hence this is done by the WebAssembly runtime:
Kubewarden's `policy-server` or `kwctl`.

The different language SDKs for Kubewarden policies take care of all that, and
provide functions for verification of container image, Kubewarden policies, Helm
charts and generally speaking any kind of OCI artifact. This ensures a safe and
tested codepath for verification. In addition, pulling data from a registry and
cryptographically verifying signatures can be time and computationally
expensive, so the WebAssembly runtime (PolicyServer, `kwctl`) ensures both
signature pulls and verification computations are cached. The cached entries
are automatically expired after 60 seconds to prevent stale data from being
served.

The SDKs provide functions similar to the following:
- ```
  verify_pub_keys_image(
      image_url: string,
      vector_of_pub_keys: vector<string>,
      vector_of_sigstore_annotations: Vector<(key, value: string)>
      )
      returns (is_trusted: bool, digest_of_verified_image: string)
  ```
- ```
  verify_keyless_exact_match(
      image_url: string,
      vector_of_tuples_issuer_and_subject: vector<(issuer, subject: string)>,
      vector_of_sigstore_annotations: vector<(key, value: string)>
      )
      returns (is_trusted: bool, digest_of_verified_image: string)
  ```

Both functions verify that the image is signed and satisfy the passed
constraints.

Note well: on success, the functions return the digest of the verified image. It
is now on the policy to ensure that containers are instantiated from that
digest, and not from tag that may or may not match that checksum digest (and
therefore be compromised).


## A concrete example

The Kubewarden team [provides a verifier policy](https://github.com/kubewarden/verify-image-signatures)
that enforces Sigstore signatures for all containers, built on Rust and with the
Rust SDK. The policy ensures that the containers are signed, and optionally,
mutates the requests appending the exact verified checksum to the tag of the
image. Check its docs for specifics.

This policy may cover all your needs, but in case you would prefer a different
UX, of course you can build on top of it or any of the other SDKs.

In case you are implementing your own language SDK, these are the functions a
policy that verifies signatures can use:
