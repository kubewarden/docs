Because of Wasm constraints at the time of writing, some cryptographic libraries
cannot be compiled to Wasm. In the meantime, Kubewarden policies needing those
can instead perform these callbacks to evaluate the cryptographic functions
host-side, receive the result, and continue with their logic.

## WaPC protocol contract

In case you are implementing your own language SDK, these are the functions
performing cryptographic checks exposed by the host:
