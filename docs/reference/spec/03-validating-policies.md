The Kubewarden policy server receives:

- Kubernetes
[`AdmissionReview`](https://godoc.org/k8s.io/api/admission/v1#AdmissionReview)
objects from the Kubernetes API server.
It then forwards the value of its `request` attribute, of type
[`AdmissionRequest`](https://godoc.org/k8s.io/api/admission/v1#AdmissionRequest),
to the policy to be evaluated.

or:

- A JSON `request` attribute containing the free-form request document,
in case of a raw policy.
Check the
[Raw policies](../../howtos/raw-policies.md)
section for more details.

The policy evaluates the `request` and states whether it should be accepted or not.
When the request is rejected,
the policy might provide the explanation message and an error code to be shown to the end user.

By convention, of the `policy-server` project,
the guest has to expose a function named `validate`,
through the waPC guest SDK,
so that the `policy-server` (waPC host) can invoke it.

The `validate` function receives a `ValidationRequest` JSON object and returns a `ValidationResponse` JSON object.

## The `ValidationRequest` object

The `ValidationRequest` is a JSON object that is received by the `validate` function.
It looks like:

```yaml
{
  "request": <AdmissionReview.request data> | <RawReviewRequest.request data>,
  "settings": {
    # your policy configuration
  }
}
```

The `settings` key points to a free-form JSON document holds the policy
specific settings.
The previous chapter focused on policies and settings.

## An example

Given the following Kubernetes `AdmissionReview`:

```yaml

## The `ValidationResponse` object

The `validate` function returns the outcome of its validation using a `ValidationResponse` object.

The `ValidationResponse` is structured in the following way:

```yaml
{
  # mandatory
  "accepted": <boolean>,

  # optional, ignored if accepted - recommended for rejections
  "message": <string>,

  # optional, ignored if accepted
  "code": <integer>,

  # optional, used by mutation policies
  "mutated_object": <string>
}
```

These `message` and `code` attributes can be specified when the request is not accepted.
The `message` is a free-form textual error and `code` represents an HTTP error code.

If the request is accepted,
the `message` and `code` values are ignored by the Kubernetes API server if present.

If `message` or `code` are provided,
and the request is not accepted,
then the Kubernetes API server returns this information, as part of the body of the error, to the Kubernetes API client that issued the rejected request.

The `mutated_object` is an optional field used only by mutating policies.
This is the topic of the next chapter.
