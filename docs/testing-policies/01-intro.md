# Testing Policies

This section covers the topic of testing Kubewarden Policies. There are two possible
personas interested in testing policies:

  * As a policy author: you're writing a Kubewarden Policy and you want to ensure
    your code behaves the way you expect.
  * As an end user: you found a Kubewarden Policy and you want to tune/test the policy
    settings before deploying it, maybe you want to keep testing these settings
    inside of your CI/CD pipelines,...

The next sections of the documentation will show how Kubewarden policies can
be tested by these two personas.
