# OCI Registries support

:::note
This is not an exhaustive list. If a registry you know or use is working correctly
with Kubewarden, or if any information described here is not accurate at this time, please open a
[Pull Request against this documentation](https://github.com/kubewarden/docs/edit/main/docs/distributing-policies/oci-registries-support.md) to fix it.
:::

Kubewarden policies are distributed as [OCI Artifacts](https://github.com/opencontainers/artifacts)
using regular OCI Registries.

Policies are stored side by side with container images. They don't require any extra setup or
maintenance than regular container images do.

## Projects that implement OCI registries

- [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/)
- [Distribution](https://github.com/distribution/distribution)
- [Quay](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-quay/): Supported, but [disabled by default in v3.6](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/use_red_hat_quay/oci-intro#other-oci-artifacts-with-quay).

## Hosted OCI registries

- [GitHub container registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry)
- [Quay.io](https://quay.io). See projects list above.

## Tools that work with OCI registries

We recommend:
- [Kwctl](https://github.com/kubewarden/kwctl) (our cli tool)
- [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) ([>= 1.9.0](https://github.com/containers/skopeo/pull/1705))
- [Crane](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/main/cmd/crane/README.md)

## Known issues

### Docker Hub

The Docker Hub does not support OCI artifacts at this time, and as such, it cannot be used to store
Kubewarden policies.

### JFrog

Although JFrog supports OCI artifacts, it is only partially possible to push to it when following
the specification. [Read more here](https://github.com/kubewarden/kwctl/issues/59)
