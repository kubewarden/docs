The Kubewarden stack comprises:

- Some [[< cluster-admission-policy >]] resources: this is how policies are
defined for Kubernetes clusters.

- Some [[< policy-server >]] resources: representing a deployment of a
Kubewarden `PolicyServer`. The Kubewarden `PolicyServer` loads and evaluates
your administrator's policies.

- Some [[< admission-policy >]] resources: policies for a defined namespace.

- A deployment of a `kubewarden-controller`: this controller monitors the
[[< cluster-admission-policy >]] resources and interacts with the Kubewarden
[[< policy-server >]] components.

:::tip

Kubewarden describes its Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
[here](reference/CRDs.md).

Kubewarden CRDs mentioned in this tutorial and in the whole documentation have
short names, which are easier to use. These are the short names for all the
CRDs:

| Resource | shortName |
| - | - |
| AdmissionPolicies | **ap** |
| ClusterAdmissionPolicies | **cap** |
| AdmissionPolicyGroups | **apg** |
| ClusterAdmissionPolicyGroups | **capg** |
| PolicyServers | **ps** |

:::

## Installation

:::info Authentication

You can retrieve Kubewarden policies from the GitHub container registry at
[https://ghcr.io](https://ghcr.io). You need authentication to use the
repository with the Kubewarden CLI, a [GitHub personal access
token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
(PAT). Their documentation guides you through creating one if you haven't
already done so. Then you authenticate with a command like:

```console
echo $PAT | docker login ghcr.io --username <my-gh-username> --password-stdin
```

:::

Deploy the Kubewarden stack using `helm` charts as follows:

```console
helm repo add kubewarden https://charts.kubewarden.io
```

```console
helm repo update kubewarden
```

Install the following Helm charts inside the `kubewarden` namespace in your
Kubernetes cluster:

- `kubewarden-crds`, which registers the [[< cluster-admission-policy >]],
  [[< admission-policy >]] and [[< policy-server >]] Custom Resource Definitions. Also,
  the [[< policy-report >]] Custom Resource Definitions used by the audit scanner.

- `kubewarden-controller`, which installs the Kubewarden controller and the
  audit scanner
  :::note
  If you need to disable the audit scanner component check the audit
  scanner installation [documentation page](../howtos/audit-scanner).
  :::

- `kubewarden-defaults`, which creates a `PolicyServer` resource named
`default`. It can also install a set of recommended policies to secure your
cluster by enforcing some well known best practices.

```console
helm install --wait -n kubewarden --create-namespace kubewarden-crds kubewarden/kubewarden-crds
```

```console
helm install --wait -n kubewarden kubewarden-controller kubewarden/kubewarden-controller
```

```console
helm install --wait -n kubewarden kubewarden-defaults kubewarden/kubewarden-defaults
```

:::caution

Since
[`v0.4.0`](https://github.com/kubewarden/kubewarden-controller/releases/tag/v0.4.0),
a `PolicyServer` resource named `default` will not be created using the
`kubewarden-controller` chart. Now a Helm chart called `kubewarden-defaults`,
installs the default policy server.

This means that if you aren't using the latest version of the
`kubewarden-controller` and are trying to upgrade or delete, your default
policy server won't be upgraded or deleted. So, you might run into issues if
you try to install the `kubewarden-defaults` with some conflicting information,
for example, the same policy server name. To be able to take advantage of
future upgrades in the `kubewarden-defaults` Helm chart remove the existing
`PolicyServer` resource created by the `kubewarden-controller` before
installing the new chart. Now you can update your policy server using Helm
upgrades without resource conflicts. When you remove the `PolicyServer`, all
the policies bound to it will be removed as well.

:::

The default configuration values are sufficient for most deployments. The
[documentation](https://charts.kubewarden.io/#configuration) describes all the
options.

### Install kwctl (Kubewarden CLI)

#### For Linux

##### Using Homebrew 
```bash
brew install kwctl
```
##### Manual Installation
###### **Step 1: Download `kwctl`**
Download the latest release of `kwctl` for Linux:
```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/kubewarden/kwctl/releases/latest/download/kwctl-linux-x86_64.zip
```

- For **ARM64** systems (e.g., Raspberry Pi), use:
  ```bash
  curl -LO https://github.com/kubewarden/kwctl/releases/latest/download/kwctl-linux-aarch64.zip
  ```

###### **Step 2: Extract the Files to new folder**
Extract the downloaded `.zip` file to new folder `kwctl-linux` :
```bash
unzip kwctl-linux-x86_64.zip -d ./kwctl-linux
```

This will extract the following files:
- `kwctl-linux-x86_64`: The `kwctl` binary.
- `kwctl-linux-x86_64.sig`: A signature file for verifying the binary.
- `kwctl-linux-x86_64.pem`: A certificate file for verifying the signature.

###### **Step 3: Go to the new directory  `kwctl-darwin`**
```shell
cd ./kwctl-darwin
```

###### **Step 4: Make the Binary Executable**
Set the executable permission for the `kwctl` binary which is file `kwctl-linux-x86_64`:
```bash
chmod +x kwctl-linux-x86_64
```

###### **Step 5: Move the Binary to `/usr/local/bin`**
Move the binary to a directory in your `PATH`:
```bash
sudo mv kwctl-linux-x86_64 /usr/local/bin/kwctl
```

###### **Step 6: Verify the Installation**
Check if `kwctl` is installed correctly:
```bash
kwctl --version
```

#### Install for Windows
##### **Step 1: Download `kwctl`**
1. Open your browser and go to the [Kubewarden releases page](https://github.com/kubewarden/kwctl/releases/latest).

2. Download the `kwctl-windows-x86_64.zip` file.

##### **Step 2: Extract the Files in a new folder `kwctl-windows`**
Extract the `.zip` file. It will contain:
- `kwctl-windows-x86_64.exe`: The `kwctl` binary.
- `kwctl-windows-x86_64.sig`: A signature file for verifying the binary.
- `kwctl-windows-x86_64.pem`: A certificate file for verifying the signature.

##### **Step 3: Rename binary file from `kwctl-windows-x86_64.exe` to `kwctl.exe`**
- to make it easy call it in `cmd` or `powershell`.

##### **Step 4: Add path of `kwctl-windows` to Your PATH**
-  Add the directory containing `kwctl-windows-x86_64.exe` to your `PATH` environment variable:
   - Open **System Properties** > **Environment Variables**.
   - Edit the `Path` variable and add the directory containing `kwctl-windows-x86_64.exe`.

##### **Step 5: Verify the Installation**
Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window and check if `kwctl` is installed correctly:
```cmd
kwctl --version
```

#### install for Apple


#### **Install Shell Completions**

### **For Bash**
```bash
kwctl completions --shell bash > ~/.bash_completion
source ~/.bash_completion
```

### **For Zsh**
```bash
kwctl completions --shell zsh > ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### **For PowerShell**
```powershell
kwctl completions --shell powershell > $PROFILE
. $PROFILE
```

- if you have this error in windows 
```powershell
Line |
  71 |  …  [CompletionResultType]::ParameterName, 'How long the bench ‘should'’ …
     |                                                                 ~
     | Missing ')' in method call.
```
- open `$PROFILE` in any editor and replace `'How long the bench ‘should'’ run` with `'How long the bench should run`.
- Re run command 
```powershell
. $PROFILE
```


## Main components

Kubewarden has three main components which you will interact with:

- The [[< policy-server >]]
- The [[< cluster-admission-policy >]]
- The [[< admission-policy >]]

### `PolicyServer`

The `kubewarden-controller` manages a Kubewarden `PolicyServer`.
You can deploy multiple [[< policy-server >]]s in the same Kubernetes cluster.

A `PolicyServer` validates incoming requests by executing Kubewarden policies against them.

This is the default `PolicyServer` configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: policies.kubewarden.io/v1
kind: PolicyServer
metadata:
  name: reserved-instance-for-tenant-a
spec:
  image: ghcr.io/kubewarden/policy-server:v1.3.0
  replicas: 2
  serviceAccountName: ~
  env:
    - name: KUBEWARDEN_LOG_LEVEL
      value: debug
```

:::note
Check the [latest released `PolicyServer` version](https://github.com/kubewarden/policy-server/pkgs/container/policy-server) and change the tag to match.
:::

Overview of the attributes of the `PolicyServer` resource:

| Required | Placeholder | Description |
|:-:| - | - |
| Y | `image`  | The name of the container image |
| Y | `replicas`  | The number of desired instances |
| N | `serviceAccountName` | The name of the `ServiceAccount` to use for the `PolicyServer` deployment. If no value is provided, the default `ServiceAccount` from the namespace, where the `kubewarden-controller` is installed, is used |
| N | `env` | The list of environment variables |
| N | `annotations` | The list of annotations |

Changing any of these attributes causes a `PolicyServer` deployment with the new configuration.

### ClusterAdmissionPolicy

The [[< cluster-admission-policy >]] resource is the core of the Kubewarden stack. It defines how policies evaluate requests.

Enforcing policies is the most common operation which a Kubernetes
administrator performs. You can declare as many policies as you want, each
targets one or more Kubernetes resources (that is, `pods`, `Custom Resource`
and others). You also specify the type of operations applied to targeted
resources. The operations available are `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` and
`CONNECT`.

Default [[< cluster-admission-policy >]] configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: policies.kubewarden.io/v1
kind: ClusterAdmissionPolicy
metadata:
  name: psp-capabilities
spec:
  policyServer: reserved-instance-for-tenant-a
  module: registry://ghcr.io/kubewarden/policies/psp-capabilities:v0.1.9
  rules:
    - apiGroups: [""]
      apiVersions: ["v1"]
      resources: ["pods"]
      operations:
        - CREATE
        - UPDATE
  mutating: true
  settings:
    allowed_capabilities:
      - CHOWN
    required_drop_capabilities:
      - NET_ADMIN
```

Overview of the attributes of the [[< cluster-admission-policy >]] resource:

| Required | Placeholder | Description |
| :--: | - | - |
| N | `policy-server` | Identifies an existing `PolicyServer` object. The policy will be served only by this `PolicyServer` instance. The policy server named `default` serves a [[< cluster-admission-policy >]] without an explicit `PolicyServer`. |
| Y | `module` | The location of the Kubewarden policy. Kubewarden permits the following schemes: |
| N | | - `registry`: The policy is downloaded from an [OCI artifacts](https://github.com/opencontainers/artifacts) compliant container registry. Example: `registry://<OCI registry/policy URL>`. |
| N | | - `http`, `https`: The policy is downloaded from a regular HTTP(s) server. Example: `https://<website/policy URL>`. |
| N | | - `file`: The policy is loaded from a file in the computer file system. Example: `file:///<policy WASM binary full path>`. |
| Y | `resources` | The Kubernetes resources evaluated by the policy. |
| Y | `operations` | What operations for the previously given types to forward to this admission policy by the API server for evaluation. |
| Y | `mutating` | A boolean value to be set to `true` for policies that can mutate incoming requests. |
| N | `settings` | A free-form object that contains the policy configuration values. |
| N | `failurePolicy` | The action to take if the request evaluated by a policy results in an error. Permitted options: |
| N | | - `Ignore`: ignore an error calling the webhook, and the API request continues. |
| N | | - `Fail`: an error calling the webhook causes the admission to fail and the API request is rejected. |

:::note

The [[< cluster-admission-policy >]] resources are registered with a `*`
webhook `scope`. This means that registered webhooks forward all requests
matching the given `resources` and `operations`, either namespaced or
cluster-wide resources.

:::

### AdmissionPolicy

[[< admission-policy >]] is a namespace-wide resource.
The policy only processes requests targeting the Namespace with
the [[< admission-policy >]] defined.
Other than that, there are no functional differences between the
[[< admission-policy >]] and [[< cluster-admission-policy >]] resources.

:::info

[[< admission-policy >]] requires Kubernetes 1.21.0 or greater. This is because
Kubewarden uses the `kubernetes.io/metadata.name` label, introduced in
Kubernetes 1.21.0

:::

The complete documentation of these Custom Resources can be found [here](https://github.com/kubewarden/kubewarden-controller/blob/main/docs/crds/README.asciidoc) or on [docs.crds.dev](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/kubewarden/kubewarden-controller).

## Example: Enforce your first policy

We will use the [`pod-privileged`](https://github.com/kubewarden/pod-privileged-policy) policy.
We want to prevent the creation of privileged containers inside our Kubernetes cluster by enforcing this policy.

Let's define a [[< cluster-admission-policy >]] to do that:

```console
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: policies.kubewarden.io/v1
kind: ClusterAdmissionPolicy
metadata:
  name: privileged-pods
spec:
  module: registry://ghcr.io/kubewarden/policies/pod-privileged:v0.2.2
  rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    apiVersions: ["v1"]
    resources: ["pods"]
    operations:
    - CREATE
    - UPDATE
  mutating: false
EOF
```

This produces the following output:

```console
clusteradmissionpolicy.policies.kubewarden.io/privileged-pods created
```

When a [[< cluster-admission-policy >]] is defined, the status is set to
`pending`, and it forces a rollout of the targeted `PolicyServer`. In our
example, it's the `PolicyServer` named `default`. You can monitor the rollout
by running the following command:

```console
kubectl get clusteradmissionpolicy.policies.kubewarden.io/privileged-pods
```

You should see the following output:

```console
NAME              POLICY SERVER   MUTATING   STATUS
privileged-pods   default         false      pending
```

Once the new policy is ready to be served, the `kubewarden-controller` will
register a
[ValidatingWebhookConfiguration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.32/#validatingwebhookconfiguration-v1-admissionregistration-k8s-io)
object.

The [[< cluster-admission-policy >]] status is set to `active` once the
Deployment completes for every `PolicyServer` instance.
Show [[< validating-webhook-configuration >]]s with the following command:

```console
kubectl get validatingwebhookconfigurations.admissionregistration.k8s.io -l kubewarden
```

You should see the following output:

```console
NAME                          WEBHOOKS   AGE
clusterwide-privileged-pods   1          9s
```

Once the [[< cluster-admission-policy >]] is active and the
[[< validating-webhook-configuration >]] registers, you can test the policy.

First, you can create a Pod with a Container _not_ in `privileged` mode:

```console
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: unprivileged-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest
EOF
```

This produces the following output:

```console
pod/unprivileged-pod created
```

The Pod is successfully created.

Now, you can create a Pod with at least one Container `privileged` flag:

```console
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: privileged-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest
      securityContext:
          privileged: true
EOF
```

The policy denies creation of the Pod and you should see the following message:

```console
Error from server: error when creating "STDIN": admission webhook "clusterwide-privileged-pods.kubewarden.admission" denied the request: Privileged container is not allowed
```

:::note

Both examples didn't define a `namespace`, which means the `default` namespace
was the target. However, as you could see in the second example, the policy is
still applied. As stated previously, this is due to the scope being
cluster-wide and not targeting a specific namespace.

:::

## Uninstall

You can remove the resources created by uninstalling the `helm` charts as
follows:

```console
helm uninstall --namespace kubewarden kubewarden-defaults
```

```console
helm uninstall --namespace kubewarden kubewarden-controller
```

```console
helm uninstall --namespace kubewarden kubewarden-crds
```

After removal of the `helm` charts remove the Kubernetes namespace that
used to deploy the Kubewarden stack:

```console
kubectl delete namespace kubewarden
```

:::caution

Kubewarden contains a helm pre-delete hook that removes all `PolicyServer`s and
`kubewarden-controller`s. Then the `kubewarden-controller` deletes all
resources, so it's important that `kubewarden-controller` is running when helm
uninstall executes.

:::

Kubewarden deletes [[< validating-webhook-configuration >]]s and
[[< mutating-webhook-configuration >]]s
it has created. Check this with:

```console
kubectl get validatingwebhookconfigurations.admissionregistration.k8s.io -l "kubewarden"
```

```console
kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfigurations.admissionregistration.k8s.io -l "kubewarden"
```

If these resources aren't automatically removed, remove them manually using
the following command:

```console
kubectl delete -l "kubewarden" validatingwebhookconfigurations.admissionregistration.k8s.io
```

```console
kubectl delete -l "kubewarden" mutatingwebhookconfigurations.admissionregistration.k8s.io
```

## Wrapping up

[[< cluster-admission-policy >]] is the core resource that a cluster operator
has to manage. The `kubewarden-controller` module automatically takes care of
the configuration for the rest of the resources needed to run the policies.

## What's next?

Now, you are ready to deploy Kubewarden! Have a look at the policies on
[artifacthub.io](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?kind=13), on
[GitHub](https://github.com/topics/kubewarden-policy), or reuse existing Rego
policies as shown in the [following
chapters](tutorials/writing-policies/rego/01-intro-rego.md).
