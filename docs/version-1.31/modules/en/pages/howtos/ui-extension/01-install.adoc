This section describes installing the {project-name} UI as an extension
of https://github.com/rancher/rancher[Rancher Manager].

== Install {short-project-name} UI Extension

You install the {short-project-name} UI as a global extension, however, you
install the {short-project-name} controller through the Rancher UI as a cluster
scoped resource.

[NOTE]
====

For air-gapped installations, follow xref:howtos/airgap/02-install.adoc[these
steps].

====


Within the Extensions page, select the "Enable" button and choose the option to
add the Rancher Extensions Repository. When enabled, the "{short-project-name}"
extension item appears automatically. Select this item to install the
extension. Once installed, you can install {short-project-name} into the
required cluster.

=== Install {short-project-name}

Following the previous steps, within your cluster a new item appears in the
side-menu for {short-project-name}. This dashboard page guides you through the
installation process, completing the prerequisites.

[NOTE]
====

During the "App Install" step of the installation wizard, the "Install
{short-project-name}" button may remain grayed out. If this happens, refresh
the page and navigate back to this step.

====


== Post-Installation

After completing the installation the dashboard page and side menu now contain
new items, namely Policy Servers, Cluster Admission Policies, and Admission
Policies. From here you can create Policy Servers and Policies to control
behavior within your cluster.

=== Enabling the default Policy Server and policies

Within the dashboard page you can select the "Install Chart" button to install the
https://github.com/kubewarden/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kubewarden-defaults[`kubewarden-defaults`]
Helm chart. This chart includes the default Policy Server and a few curated
policies.

After installing the chart, you can view the default Policy Server details with
the related policies in a sortable table.

=== Creating policies

When creating policies, you are initially given a "Custom Policy" option from
the Policy Grid. Provide the required information for your policy's Name,
Module, and Rules. It's recommended to add the Policy Catalog repository to
access {short-project-name}'s official policies.

=== Additional features

Follow the instructions to include
xref:howtos/ui-extension/02-metrics.adoc[Monitoring] or
xref:howtos/ui-extension/03-tracing.adoc[Tracing].

== Air-gapped installation

As {short-project-name} is a Rancher Official Extension, the Rancher team
provides a mechanism to automatically generate an Extension Catalog Image. This
becomes added to the `rancher-images.txt` file when
https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/air-gapped-helm-cli-install/publish-images#1-find-the-required-assets-for-your-rancher-version[installing
Rancher Manager] for air-gapped instances.

Once this image is mirrored to a registry accessible to your air-gapped
cluster, you can import the image within the Rancher UI. This creates a local
Helm repository with the {short-project-name} UI chart for installation.

=== Installation steps
