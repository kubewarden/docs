== Policy testing personas

This section covers the topic of testing {project-name} Policies.
There are two personas interested in testing policies:

* *Policy developer*: you're writing a {short-project-name} Policy and you want to make sure your code behaves the way you expect.
* *Cluster operator*: you found a {short-project-name} Policy and you want to test and tune the policy settings before deploying it.
You want to keep testing these settings in your CI/CD pipelines, and other administrative tasks.

The next sections of the documentation shows how these personas can test {short-project-name} policies.
