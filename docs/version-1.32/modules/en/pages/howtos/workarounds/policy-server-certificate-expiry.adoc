[IMPORTANT]
.Workaround for {project-name} v1.16.0 and earlier
====

This workaround is only needed for {short-project-name} v1.16.0 and earlier.
Starting from v1.17.0, the controller automatically renews the policy server
certificates.

====

During the release process for v1.14, the {short-project-name} discovered a bug
related to the policy server certificate rotation. The Root CA configuration is
for 10-year expiry, but each policy-server certificate secret has a one-year
expiry. However, the controller is currently unable to renew them
automatically.

In the v1.14 release, the {short-project-name} ensured that policy-server
secrets are created with a 10-year expiry.

An automated renewal process is in place for release ≥ v1.16.0.

Until then, users can manually delete the expired certificate secret
(policy-server-default) and trigger a controller reconciliation. You do this by
adding, removing, or updating a policy or by adjusting the number of replicas
of a PolicyServer.
