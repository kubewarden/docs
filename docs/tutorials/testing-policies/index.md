## Policy testing personas

This section covers the topic of testing Kubewarden Policies.
We define two personas interested in testing policies:

- **policy author**: you're writing a Kubewarden Policy and you want to ensure your code behaves the way you expect.

- **cluster operator**: you found a Kubewarden Policy and you want to test and tune the policy settings before deploying it.
Maybe you want to keep testing these settings inside of your CI/CD pipelines,...

The next sections of the documentation shows how Kubewarden policies might be tested by these personas.
