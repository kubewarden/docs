# Introduction

Kubewarden is a [Kubernetes Dynamic Admission
Controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/)
that validates incoming requests against WebAssembly policies. The policies can be developed in any programming language that generates WebAssembly binaries.

## What is WebAssembly?

As stated on [WebAssembly's official website](https://webassembly.org/):

> WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a
> stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable
> compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on
> the web for client and server applications.

Wasm was originally conceived as a browser "extension".
However, efforts are being made by the WebAssembly
community to allow the execution of Wasm code outside
browsers.

## Why use WebAssembly?

Users can write Kubernetes policies using their
favorite programming language, provided its toolchain can generate
Wasm binaries.

Wasm modules are portable, once built they can run on any kind of
processor architecture and operating system. For example, a policy developed and built on Apple
Silicon can run on AMD64/Intel64 Linux without conversion.

Policy authors can reuse their skills, tools and best
practices. Policies are "traditional" programs that can have reusable
blocks (regular libraries), can be linted and tested, and be
plugged into current CI and CD workflows.

## Policy distribution

Kubewarden policies can be served by a regular web server or,
better, be published from an OCI compliant registry.

Kubewarden policies can be stored inside an OCI compliant registry as
[OCI artifacts](https://github.com/opencontainers/artifacts).
