When using the Kubewarden Audit Scanner, the results of the policy scans are stored using the
[PolicyReport](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/wg-policy-prototypes/blob/045372e558b896695b2daae92e8c7a04d4d40282/policy-report/docs/index.html)
Custom Resource.

:::caution

The PolicyReport CRDs are under development in the `wg-policy` Kubernetes group.
Therefore, this documentation will become out of date if a new version of the CRDs is released.

Check the `wg-policy` group
[repository](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/wg-policy-prototypes)
for more information about the CRDs.

:::

These CRDs offer a structured way to store and manage the audit results.

Each namespace scanned by the audit scanner has a dedicated `PolicyReport` resource defined in it.

The results of Cluster wide resources are found in a `ClusterPolicyReport` object.
There will be only one `ClusterPolicyReport` per cluster.

The audit results generated by the scanner include:

- the policy that was evaluated
- the resource being scanned
- the result of the evaluation (pass, fail, or skip)
- a timestamp indicating when the evaluation took place.

You can also define severity and category annotations for your policies.

Operators can access the reports via ordinary `kubectl` commands.
They can also use the optional UI provided by the
[policy-reporter](https://kyverno.github.io/policy-reporter)
open source project for monitoring and observability of the PolicyReport CRDs.

## Policy Reporter UI

The Policy Reporter is shipped as a subchart of `kubewarden-controller`.
Refer to the [Audit Scanner Installation](../../howtos/audit-scanner)
page for more information.

The Policy Reporter UI provides a dashboard showcasing all violations
from `PolicyReports` and the `ClusterPolicyReport`.
This is shown below.

![Policy Reporter dashboard example](/img/policy-reporter_dashboard.png)

As shown below,
it also provides a tab for PolicyReports, and a tab for ClusterPolicyReports, with expanded information.

Other features of Policy Reporter include forwarding of results to different clients
(like Grafana Loki, Elasticsearch, chat applications),
metrics endpoints, and so on.
See the [policy-reporter's community docs](https://kyverno.github.io/policy-reporter)
for more information.

## Cluster-Wide Audit Results example

In the next example, the audit scanner has evaluated the `cap-testing-cap-policy` on many namespaces in the cluster.
The results indicate that all the namespaces passed the policy validation.
The `summary` section summarizes the audit results, showing there were no errors, failures, or warnings.

```yaml
apiVersion: wgpolicyk8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterPolicyReport
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2023-07-10T19:25:40Z"
  generation: 1
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kubewarden
  ...
results:
- policy: cap-testing-cap-policy
  ...
  resourceSelector: {}
  resources:
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    name: kube-system
    ...
  result: pass
  rule: testing-cap-policy
  source: kubewarden
  timestamp:
    nanos: 0
    seconds: 1689017140
- policy: cap-testing-cap-policy
  ...
  resourceSelector: {}
  resources:
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    name: default
    ...
  result: pass
  rule: testing-cap-policy
  source: kubewarden
  timestamp:
    nanos: 0
    seconds: 1689017140
...
summary:
  error: 0
  fail: 0
  pass: 6
  skip: 0
  warn: 0
```

## Namespace-Specific Audit Results example

In this example, the audit scanner evaluated many policies on resources within the `default` namespace.
The results indicate that certain resources failed the validation for the `cap-no-privilege-escalation` policy.
Others passed the validation for the `cap-do-not-run-as-root` policy.
The `summary` section shows the number of failures and passes.

```yaml
apiVersion: wgpolicyk8s.io/v1beta1
kind: PolicyReport
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2023-07-10T19:28:05Z"
  generation: 4
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kubewarden
  ...
results:
- message: one of the containers has privilege escalation enabled
  policy: cap-no-privilege-escalation
  ...
  resourceSelector: {}
  resources:
  - apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: nginx-deployment
    namespace: default
    ...
  result: fail
  rule: no-privilege-escalation
  source: kubewarden
  timestamp:
    nanos: 0
    seconds: 1689017383
- policy: cap-do-not-run-as-root
  ...
  resourceSelector: {}
  resources:
  - apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: nginx-deployment
    namespace: default
    ...
  result: pass
  rule: do-not-run-as-root
  source: kubewarden
  timestamp:
    nanos: 0
    seconds: 1689017383
...
summary:
  error: 0
  fail: 8
  pass: 10
  skip: 0
  warn: 0
```
