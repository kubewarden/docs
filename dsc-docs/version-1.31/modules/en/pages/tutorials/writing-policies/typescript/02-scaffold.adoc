This tutorial covers creating a policy that validates the hostnames of Pod objects.

The policy is to reject all Pods that use one or more hostnames on the deny list.
You provide policy configuration using runtime settings.

To summarize, the policy settings should look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
denied_hostnames:
  - bad-host
  - forbidden-host
----

The policy rejects the creation of this Pod:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  hostname: bad-host
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest
----

However, it accepts the creation of this Pod:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  hostname: allowed-host
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest
----

== Scaffolding a new policy project

You can create a new policy project using the https://github.com/kubewarden/js-policy-template[template repository]. Select the "Use this template" green button near the top of the page and follow GitHub's wizard.
Clone the repository locally and update the `package.json` file to reflect your policy details:

[source,json]
----
{
  "name": "your-policy-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Your policy description",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/your-username/your-policy-name"
  }
}
----

Make sure to use a repository path that matches your actual GitHub repository.

== Testing

Provided the necessary tools are in place, the `make all` command builds the `annotated-policy.wasm` target. The command `make e2e` runs tests using `bats` with `kwctl`.
