This page lists the dependencies of Kubewarden, with their relevant
version constraints. Versions outside of the provided ranges may work but are
not tested.

== OpenTelemetry, metrics and tracing dependencies

At the time of writing, the https://opentelemetry.io[OpenTelemetry] stack keeps
improving. However, it’s not yet stable, and unannounced,
backwards-incompatible changes still happen. The Kubewarden developers endeavor
to track OpenTelemetry stack changes and adjust to them. The project tests
against a known working range of OpenTelemetry, metrics and tracing stack.
