You distribute your {project-name} policies as
https://opencontainers.org[OCI Artifacts]
using regular Open Container Initiative (OCI) registries.

{short-project-name} policy storage is alongside container images.
They don't require extra setup or maintenance
other than that needed for regular container images.

[NOTE]
====
You can add a registry that works with {short-project-name} or
correct any registry inaccuracies by using the
"Edit this page" button at the bottom of the page

== Tools that work with OCI registries

The {short-project-name} project recommends:

* https://github.com/kubewarden/kwctl[`kwctl`] (our CLI tool).
* https://github.com/containers/skopeo[Skopeo] (https://github.com/containers/skopeo/pull/1705[≥ 1.9.0]).

== Known issues

=== Docker Hub

Currently, Docker Hub doesn't support OCI artifacts so can't be used to store {short-project-name} policies.
Docker Inc. has announced that Docker Hub will support OCI artifacts in the
https://www.docker.com/blog/announcing-docker-hub-oci-artifacts-support/[future].

=== JFrog

Although JFrog supports OCI artifacts,
it's only partially possible to push to it, when following their specification.
