This section shows how you can write end-to-end tests running against the actual WebAssembly binary produced by the Javy compilation toolchain.

== Prerequisites

Recall, you need these tools on your development machine:

* `bats`: Used to write the tests and automate their execution.
* `kwctl` >= v1.30: CLI tool provided by {project-name} to run its policies outside of Kubernetes, among other actions. It's covered in xref:/tutorials/testing-policies/index.adoc[the testing policies section] of the documentation.

== Writing tests

You'll be using `bats` to write and automate your tests. Each test has the following steps:

. Run the policy using `kwctl run` directly with the JSON resource file.
. Perform assertions against the output produced by `kwctl`.

All the end-to-end tests go in a file called `e2e.bats`. The project scaffolding project includes an example, `e2e.bats`. You need to extend its contents to provide comprehensive test coverage for your policy behavior.

== Test data files

The end-to-end test cases test the creation of specific Kubernetes Resources.

For example, when testing the creation of a Pod resource:

[source,json]
----
{
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "kind": "Pod",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "test-pod"
  },
  "spec": {
    "containers": [
      {
        "name": "nginx",
        "image": "nginx:latest"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

The end-to-end testcase uses a JSON file containing a Kubernetes AdmissionReview. These JSON object AdmissionReviews JSONs are the ones that are sent
against the Kubernetes API so they get xref:/reference/spec/03-validating-policies.adoc#an-example[validated].

You can obtain AdmissionReviews JSON objects by using `kwctl scaffold admission-request`.
Have a look at `test_data/pod.json` to see an AdmissionRequest JSON with a Pod.

== Basic test cases

The template already provides several basic tests. Here's how the complete `e2e.bats` file should look:

[source,bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bats
----

Here are the existing tests with explanations:

=== Test 1: Reject denied hostnames

[source,bash]
----
@test "reject because hostname is on deny list" {
  run kwctl run annotated-policy.wasm -r test_data/pod_with_hostname.json --settings-json '{"denied_hostnames": ["forbidden-host", "test-hostname"]}'

  # this prints the output when one of the checks below fails
  echo "output = ${output}"

  # request rejected
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  [ $(expr "$output" : '.*allowed.*false') -ne 0 ]
  [ $(expr "$output" : ".*Pod hostname 'test-hostname' is not allowed.*") -ne 0 ]
}
----

This test ensures the policy rejects Pods when their hostname is in the deny list.

=== Test 2: Accept allowed hostnames

[source,bash]
----
@test "accept because hostname is not on the deny list" {
  run kwctl run annotated-policy.wasm -r test_data/pod_with_hostname.json --settings-json '{"denied_hostnames": ["forbidden-host"]}'

  # this prints the output when one of the checks below fails
  echo "output = ${output}"

  # request accepted
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  [ $(expr "$output" : '.*allowed.*true') -ne 0 ]
}
----

This test verifies the policy accepts Pods when their hostname isn't in the deny list.

=== Test 3: Accept when no settings provided

[source,bash]
----
@test "accept because the deny list is empty" {
  run kwctl run annotated-policy.wasm -r test_data/pod_with_hostname.json

  # this prints the output when one of the checks below fails
  echo "output = ${output}"

  # request accepted
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  [ $(expr "$output" : '.*allowed.*true') -ne 0 ]
}
----

This test ensures the policy accepts requests when you provide no settings.

=== Test 4: Accept pods without hostnames

[source,bash]
----
@test "accept because pod has no hostname set" {
  run kwctl run annotated-policy.wasm -r test_data/pod.json --settings-json '{"denied_hostnames": ["forbidden-host"]}'

  # this prints the output when one of the checks below fails
  echo "output = ${output}"

  # request accepted (no hostname to check)
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  [ $(expr "$output" : '.*allowed.*true') -ne 0 ]
}
----

This test verifies that the policy accepts Pods without hostnames regardless of the deny list.

=== Test 5: Accept non-Pod resources

[source,bash]
----
@test "accept non-pod resources" {
  run kwctl run annotated-policy.wasm -r test_data/service.json --settings-json '{"denied_hostnames": ["forbidden-host"]}'

  # this prints the output when one of the checks below fails
  echo "output = ${output}"

  # request accepted (not a pod)
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  [ $(expr "$output" : '.*allowed.*true') -ne 0 ]
}
----

This test ensures the policy accepts resources that aren't Pods, since the policy only validates Pod hostnames.

== Extended test coverage

You can extend the test coverage by adding more test scenarios:

=== Test 6: Settings validation

You can also add tests to verify settings validation works correctly:

[source,bash]
----
@test "accept valid settings" {
  run kwctl run annotated-policy.wasm -r test_data/pod.json --settings-json '{"denied_hostnames": ["host1", "host2"]}'

  # this prints the output when one of the checks below fails
  echo "output = ${output}"

  # settings are valid, request processed normally
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  [ $(expr "$output" : '.*allowed.*true') -ne 0 ]
}
----

=== Test 7: Edge cases

[source,bash]
----
@test "reject with multiple denied hostnames" {
  run kwctl run annotated-policy.wasm -r test_data/pod_with_hostname.json --settings-json '{"denied_hostnames": ["bad-host", "test-hostname", "forbidden-host"]}'

  # this prints the output when one of the checks below fails
  echo "output = ${output}"

  # request rejected
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  [ $(expr "$output" : '.*allowed.*false') -ne 0 ]
  [ $(expr "$output" : ".*Pod hostname 'test-hostname' is not allowed.*") -ne 0 ]
}
----

[source,bash]
----
@test "accept with empty denied hostnames array" {
  run kwctl run annotated-policy.wasm -r test_data/pod_with_hostname.json --settings-json '{"denied_hostnames": []}'

  # this prints the output when one of the checks below fails
  echo "output = ${output}"

  # request accepted
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  [ $(expr "$output" : '.*allowed.*true') -ne 0 ]
}
----

== Running the tests

You can run all the end-to-end tests by using this command:

[source,console]
----
make e2e
----

This produces output like:

[source,console]
----
bats e2e.bats
e2e.bats
 ✓ reject because hostname is on the deny list
 ✓ accept because hostname is not on the deny list
 ✓ accept because the deny list is empty
 ✓ accept because pod has no hostname set
 ✓ accept non-pod resources
 ✓ accept valid settings
 ✓ reject with multiple denied hostnames
 ✓ accept with empty denied hostnames array

8 tests, 0 failures
----

== Understanding test output

Each test uses `kwctl` to run the policy and checks:

* Exit status: The command `kwctl` should exit with status 0 for successful policy execution.
* Allowed field: The JSON output contains an `allowed` field indicating if the request was accepted.
* Message content: For rejected requests, the output contains a descriptive error message.

The `echo "output = $\{output}"` statements in each test help with debugging by showing the actual policy output when a test fails.

== Conclusion

The end-to-end tests provide comprehensive coverage of the policy behavior by testing against the actual WebAssembly binary. This ensures that the policy works correctly when deployed in {short-project-name}, not just in the TypeScript development environment.

[TIP]
====
For more comprehensive examples of end-to-end tests, you can explore the https://github.com/kubewarden/policy-sdk-js/blob/main/demo_policy/e2e.bats[policy-sdk-js source code], which includes extensive e2e tests demonstrating each of {short-project-name}'s host capabilities. These tests can serve as inspiration for testing more advanced policy features like networking, cryptographic operations, and OCI registry interactions.
