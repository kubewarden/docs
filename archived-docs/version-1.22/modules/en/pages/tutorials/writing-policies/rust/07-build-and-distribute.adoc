== Building the policy

Thus far, you've built the policy with a compilation target of the same operating system and architecture of your development machine.

It's now time to build the policy as a WebAssembly binary, a `.wasm` file.

You use the command:

[subs="+attributes",console]
----
make policy.wasm
----

This command builds the code in release mode, with a WebAssembly compilation target.

The build produces a `policy.wasm` file:

[subs="+attributes",console]
----
$ file policy.wasm
policy.wasm: WebAssembly (wasm) binary module version 0x1 (MVP)
----

== Distributing the policy

Kubewarden documents policy distribution in the
xref:../../../explanations/distributing-policies.adoc[distributing policies]
section.

== More examples

You can find more Rust Kubewarden policies in Kubewarden's GitHub space.
https://github.com/search?l=Rust&q=topic%3Apolicy-as-code+org%3Akubewarden&type=Repositories[This query]
can help you find them.

The Kubewarden policy repositories, shown by that query, have GitHub Actions that automate the following tasks:

* Run unit tests and code linting on pull requests and after code merges into the main branch.
* Build the policy in `release` mode and push it to an OCI registry as an artifact.
