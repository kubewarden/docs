[IMPORTANT]
.Workaround for Kubewarden v1.16.0 and earlier
====
This workaround is only needed for Kubewarden v1.16.0 and earlier. Starting from
v1.17.0, the controller automatically renews the policy server certificates.
====

During the release process for v1.14, a bug related to the policy server certificate rotation was discovered.
The Root CA is configured to expire in 10 years, but each policy-server certificate secret has a one-year expiry.
However, the controller is currently unable to renew them automatically.

In the v1.14 release, we have ensured that policy-server secrets are created with a 10-year expiry.

For future releases we'll implement an automated renewal process.

Until then, users can manually delete the expired certificate secret (policy-server-default) and trigger a controller reconciliation.
You do this by adding, removing, or updating a policy or by adjusting the number of replicas of a PolicyServer.
